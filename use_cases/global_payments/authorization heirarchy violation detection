# Authorization Hierarchy Violation Detection

## Project Overview
Building a detection system for authorization hierarchy violations using UHG principles, focusing on insider threats and privilege escalation patterns.

## Insider Threat Focus

### Primary Focus: Insider Threats
- System designed to detect internal actors attempting privilege escalation
- Covers both SOAR-specific and enterprise system access
- Uses temporal analysis for unusual access pattern detection
- Focuses on gradual privilege accumulation detection

### Privilege Escalation Scope

#### Within SOAR:
- Monitors playbook execution permissions
- Tracks automation rule modifications
- Controls API key usage and scope
- Monitors access to sensitive playbooks and resources

#### Within Company:
- Active Directory privilege changes
- Cloud resource access patterns
- Database access level modifications
- Application role changes

### Key API Keys and Environment Variables
Required configurations include:
- SOAR API keys for integration
- Authentication system credentials
- Monitoring system access
- Database connectivity for tracking

### Detection Mechanisms
Multiple detection layers:
- Rapid privilege escalation detection (5-minute window)
- Pattern-based analysis of access behavior
- Temporal anomaly detection
- Cross-system privilege abuse monitoring

## Current Status
- Implementation phase
- Core functionality complete
- Performance optimization in progress
- Advanced pattern detection implemented
