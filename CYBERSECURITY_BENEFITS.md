## Implementation Examples

### Feature Extraction for DDoS Detection
```python
# Example of how UHG captures DDoS patterns
ddos_features = {
    'packet_rate': high_volume_traffic,
    'packet_size': small_packet_sizes,
    'temporal_pattern': regular_intervals
}

# UHG preserves these patterns despite:
# 1. Traffic volume manipulation
# 2. Packet timing changes
# 3. Distribution across sources
```

### Port Scan Detection
```python
# UHG geometric features capture scanning behavior
scan_patterns = {
    'port_sequence': sequential_or_random,
    'timing': high_frequency_probes,
    'distribution': source_target_relationships
}

# Preserved under:
# 1. Rate manipulation
# 2. Scan pattern changes
# 3. Distributed scanning
```
